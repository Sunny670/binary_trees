# C - Binary trees :pencil2:

> C is a powerful general-purpose programming language. It can be used to develop operating systems, databases, compilers, and many more.

We should understand and be able to answer this questions by the end of this project:
  
* What a binary tree is?
* What is the difference between a binary tree and a Binary Search Tree
* What are the depth, the height, the size of a binary tree
* What are the different traversal methods to go through a binary tree
* What is the possible gain in terms of time complexity compared to linked lists
* What is a complete, a full, a perfect, a balanced binary tree
