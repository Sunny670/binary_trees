# C - Binary trees :pencil2:

> C is a powerful general-purpose programming language. It can be used to develop operating systems, databases, compilers, and many more.

We should understand and be able to answer this questions by the end of this project:
  
* What a binary tree is?
* What is the difference between a binary tree and a Binary Search Tree
* What are the depth, the height, the size of a binary tree
* What are the different traversal methods to go through a binary tree
* What is the possible gain in terms of time complexity compared to linked lists
* What is a complete, a full, a perfect, a balanced binary tree

## Tasks :heavy_check_mark:

0. Creates a binary tree node
1. Inserts a node as the left-child of another node
2. Inserts a node as the right-child of another node
3. Deletes an entire binary tree
4. Checks if a node is a leaf
5. Checks if a given node is a root
6. Goes through a binary tree using pre-order traversal
7. Goes through a binary tree using in-order traversal
8. Goes through a binary tree using post-order traversal
9. Measures the height of a binary tree
10. Measures the depth of a node in a binary tree
11. Measures the size of a binary tree
12. Counts the leaves in a binary tree
13. Counts the nodes with at least 1 child in a binary tree
14. Measures the balance factor of a binary tree
15. Checks if a binary tree is full
16. Checks if a binary tree is perfect
17. Finds the sibling of a node
18. Finds the uncle of a node
19. Finds the lowest common ancestor of two nodes
